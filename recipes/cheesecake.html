                <strong>Lasagna</strong> is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough 
                based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that 
                varies based on different local traditions.

            <strong>These are the steps required in order to make a cheesecake:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Position an oven shelf in the middle of the oven. Heat the oven to 180C/ 160C fan/ gas 4.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin by putting a square piece of parchment paper or foil on top of the tin base and then clipping the 
                    side on so the paper or foil is trapped and any excess sticks out of the bottom.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the crust, melt 85g butter in a medium pan. Stir in 140g digestive biscuit crumbs and 1 tbsp golden caster or granulated sugar so the mixture 
                    is evenly moistened.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while preparing the filling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the filling, increase the oven temperature to fan 220C/ 200C fan/ gas 7. In a table top mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat 900g 
                    full-fat soft cheese at medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With the mixer on low, gradually add 250g golden caster sugar, then 3 tbsp plain flour and a pinch of salt, scraping down the sides of the bowl 
                    and the paddle twice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Swap the paddle attachment for the whisk. Continue by adding 1½ tsp vanilla extract, 2 tsp lemon zest and 1½ tsp lemon juice. Whisk in 3 large eggs 
                    and 1 yolk, one at a time, scraping the bowl and whisk at least twice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir a 284ml carton of soured cream until smooth, then measure 200ml (just over ¾ of the carton). Continue on low speed as you add the measured soured 
                    cream (reserve the rest). Whisk to blend, but don't over-beat. The batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy.
                </li>
            </ol>
